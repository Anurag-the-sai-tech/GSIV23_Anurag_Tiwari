⇒ Instructions
Below are the steps to run this React Application:
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Go to './src/features/api/apiBase.tsx' file and replace 'accessToken' with your 'accessToken' and save it.
5. Run the development server by using this command in the terminal: npm start
6. Access the app in your browser: http://localhost:3000


⇒ Features Implemented
1. Component: The codebase features a streamlined component architecture. Components are structured and reusable, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.
2. Routing implemented: This is a two page application, 'List' page where we can see list of all the moview and search it. Another page is 'details' page which shows all the details of any perticular movie.
3. Connect to API: Movies retrieved, data parsed and presented in List page and Details paage
4. Connect to API: Search, search functionality is working
5. State Management: For State management I'm using Redux. Redux stores are properly configured, and components access and update state appropriately.
6. Handling of async operations
7. Responsive Design: This application is fully responsive for all the devices.


⇒ Improvements
If given more time, the following enhancements can be made:
1. Unit testing: I could implement unit testing
2. I can avoid inline css (in some places I have used inline styles)
3. I can make our application more beautiful from UI point of view


⇒ Feedback
Overall, the challenge is excellent for assessing React proficiency and application development skills.
